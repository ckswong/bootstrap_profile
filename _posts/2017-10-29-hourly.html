<h2>Hourly App</h2>

<img class="img-fluid" src="./../assets/hourly.png" />

<p>This example is drawn from the site, <a href="http://hourly-app.com/">hourly-app.com</a>.</p>

<p>What I appreciate about the design of this banner is the creativity in color and scale. The designer chose to limit the page to one typeface (Helvetica-ish) and limit the color palette to three colors, yet is able to use minimal color and type effectively.</p>

<p>In this banner,  there is very effective use of color contrast to convey the message as a call to action. The red type is striking against the neutral black and beige, and attention is naturally drawn to the red text. In this case, the eyes are drawn first to ‘hourly’, the name of the company, then drawn to ‘download’, the call to action. </p>

<p>This site also uses type size effectively to denote the informational hierarchy. We naturally read from top to bottom, but with the use of dramatically different type size, our attention is first drawn to read ‘hourly,’ giving us the name of the company. This is followed by ‘ios app for time tracking,’ which the provides the next important bit of information: a brief description of what the product does. Finally, our eyes are drawn to the smallest type, which gives less important, but more detailed information about the product. </p>

<p>Lastly, from an aesthetic perspective,  the use of smaller, off-white colored text to fill the negative space left by the ‘hourly’ text gives a great sense of balance in this section. </p>
