<p>The Olympus 35RC is a 35mm rangefinder camera that was released in 1970. It’s brilliant in its minimal and utilitarian design.</p>

<p>From the front, you can see that logo and self-timer lever fill the negative space of the top plate, that balances the dark viewfinder on the right. The top plate itself balanced by the black leatherette, which takes about 2/3 the area of the front face of the camera. This extra negative space helps to balance the silver top plate and its density of components. </p>

<p>However, it is the top view where you see the brilliance in the user interface design. On the right hand side of the camera, your eye is drawn to the shutter speed dial. A simple black line to the left of the dial is a subtle and simple indicator for what the current shutter speed setting is. The dial itself has ridged edges, which is an affordance to the user, that indicates that this dial can rotate. Another feature of the dial is the value ’30’, which is painted red. Red is a great warning signifier, that it is the lowest safe shutter speed to shoot without hand shake to blur the image. On the right side of the top plate, the frame counter with an orange triangle, signifying which frame count the camera is on.

<p>Finally, there is the barrel of the lens. There are two dials around the lens, and the separation of their function is clearly delineated by their contrasting colors; the focusing ring is in black and the aperture ring is in silver.  Both dials have ridges, which affords rotation and is an informs the user how settings can be set. Finally, both rings use contrasting colors well. The focusing ring uses the color yellow to distinguish English from metric units of measurement, while the aperture ring employs red to bring emphasis to ‘A,’ or auto mode and the ‘off’ mode.  </p>
