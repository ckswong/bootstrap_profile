<h2 id="thedesignoftheolympus35rc">The Design of the Olympus 35RC</h2>

<img class="fluid">[image:355A7D83-5FF7-4C31-BAAB-A13F35A3B7CB-1561-000016104CF2ED8D/oly35front.jpg]</p>

<p>The Olympus 35RC is a 35mm rangefinder camera that was released in 1970. It’s brilliant in its minimal and utilitarian design.</p>

<p>From the front, you can see that logo and self-timer lever fill the negative space of the top plate in a way that balances the dark viewfinder on the right. The top plate itself balanced by the black leatherette, which takes about 2/3 the area of the front face of the camera. This extra negative space helps to balance the silver top plate and its density of components. </p>

<p>However, it is the top view where you see the brilliance in the user interface design. On the right hand side of the camera, your eye is drawn to the shutter speed dial. A simple black line to the left of the dial is a subtle and simple indicator for what the current shutter speed setting is. The dial itself has ridged edges, which is an affordance to the user that indicates to the user that this dial can rotate. Another feature of the dial is the value ’30’, which is painted red. The red is a great warning signifier to the user that it is the lowest safe shutter speed to shoot without hand shake to blur the image. 
In addition, we see on the right side of the top plate, the frame counter with a big triangle, signifying what frame count the camera is one.  </p>

<p>Finally, there is the barrel of the lens. There are two dials around the lens and the separation of their function is clearly delineated by their contrasting colors - the focusing ring is in black and the aperture ring is in silver.  Both dials also have ridges, which affords rotation and is an indication to the user how these settings can be made. Finally, both rings use contrasting colors well. The focusing ring uses the color yellow to distinguish English from metric units of measurement, while the aperture ring uses red to bring emphasis to ‘A’ or auto mode and the ‘off’ mode. </p>
