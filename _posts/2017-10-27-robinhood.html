<h2>The Design of Robinhood</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">

  <div class="col">
    <p class='robinhood'>Robinhood is a stock trading app. <i>All screenshots are from Google</i>.</p>

    <p>The first image is of the homepage of the Robinhood app. There is good use of negative space and contrast to convey importance.</p>

    <p>Using the dark shade of green-grey as the background, a canvas is provided to contrast with the white typeface. This puts a strong emphasis on the most important information to the user- the total dollar value of the user’s stock portfolio.</p>

    <p>Due to the choice of minimizing the amount of information provided on the screen, there is ample open space, to allow the chart of ‘value-over-time’ to be displayed simply, with the green line graph.  </p>
    
    <p>
      Below the line graph, there is the word ‘all’ in white with a green underline. This is a clean and minimal way to signify which chart view the user is currently in and implies what other views are available. 
    </p>

    <p>Finally, there is a good use of a ‘deck of cards’ mental model at the bottom of the screen to allow the user to scroll through the personalized notifications about stock news or updated features. By only presenting one notification at a time (or conversely, hiding many notifications), the screen is less cluttered and presents a cleaner view for the user.</p>
